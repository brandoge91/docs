# Stratus

> Stratus is a multi-purpose discord bot, here, I am going to show you how to completely set Stratus up in your server. :thumbsup:

Stratus is a bot that is made by brandonn#9609, with modules such as Roblox integrations, Moderation, and a suggestion system.
Check out the bot on [top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/785554890281844738), and on [Discord Bot List](https://discordbotlist.com/bots/stratus). 

We strived to make one of the most wide range of features, so your server isn't cluttered with bots like Dyno, Mee6, and BloxRank. We combined them all into one, easy to use bot, invitable [here](https://add.fused.fans)!
