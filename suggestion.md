# Setting up a Suggestion System

> The suggestion system is easy to set up, and helps your server out by taking suggestions to improve the community, _**from**_ the community!

Alright, so you have Stratus in your server, now what? You may feel like playing around with it, changing the prefix, and doing stuff. That's fine and all, but this article teaches you to set up a suggestion system to collect feedback from your community.

*For this I am going to pretend my prefix is !, but replace ! with your prefix you might have set.*

First, you would want to create a channel for suggestions, and make sure the bot can send messages there, I am going to use a channel called #suggestions.

Then, run the following command to set the channel, remember to change #suggestions with your channel!

`!setsuggestionchannel #suggestions`

Great! Once you run that, your suggestion system is all set up. Now you just wait for your members to suggest something using:

`!suggest <suggestion here>`
